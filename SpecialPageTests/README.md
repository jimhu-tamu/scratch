Testing Special Page coding

Problem: OMPwiki special page to create new strains is not working. Hypothesis that this is related to HTMLform callback

Test by making minimal pages to create new pages with and without using HTMLform to make the submission form
* LoremPage1 - without HTMLform
* LoremPage2 - with HTMLform, page creation in the callback

20190426: Both work: hypothesis falsified.
